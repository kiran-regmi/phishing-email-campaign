# Master Card - running a phishing email campaign 
At Mastercard, one of the ways to mitigate phishing threats is by educating people about the risks and how to identify them. An effective way to build awareness is through **phishing simulation campaigns:**

In this project, 
- Testing all the staff by sending a fake phishing email that is made to look like something a bad actor would send.
- Utilizing the results of the simulated test to help us design and implement future training.

# What is Phishing?
* Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone/something to get information, in most cases, this is usually a password.
* Attackers may send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or lure them into providing financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
* Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. So it’s very important that we keep the business and our staff safe from harm.

# How to stop getting phished?
* If it’s too good to be true it probably is.
* Always be suspicious. Better safe than sorry.
* Double check with other employees on a separate communication channel.
For example, in the rewards card phishing email above, you could confirm by calling Rewards Services about the employee card being sent out before clicking on the email.

# Remember to always:
* Check the URL of the website is correct.
* Always be suspicious of any email requesting personal information.
* Use a password manager to securely store unique passwords for each website.
* Use a secondary/side channel to double check when someone requests you to do something.
